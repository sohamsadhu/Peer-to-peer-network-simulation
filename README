The following is a network simulation for Peer to Peer network in Java.
The specifications for the project including how it should be executed is given in the file project01.shtml.

Please note that the application made uses special Java Libraries created by Prof. Alan Kaminsky (www.cs.rit.edu/~ark)
hence you would have to add the two jar files provided here to your classpath to execute the same.

A indication of how to run the program is given in the file testcases.txt which shows the kind of commands
you need to execute on the bash shell to see this working. The data files corresponding are also provided.

Do note that Log program, each of the nodes that simulated a peer node, a start for registry server, and the query 
program will need to work on different shel or their own terminals.

* The implementation is still a bit buggy given that if two nodes simultaneously ask a node for the same entry not
contained there then it goes in a infinite loop. The solution is throw a synchronised keyword somewhere, but is not
straight forward and still needs to be worked on.
